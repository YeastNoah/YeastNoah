- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @YeastNoah.
- Iâ€™m interested in learning game development in C++. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to use SDL2 rn
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, It's simply a hobby which I hope to have a future with. 
* How to reach me... Don't, I am 14 and cannot put my studies to use YET.
