- 👋 Hi, I’m @YeastNoah .
- 👀 I’m interested in learning game development in C++. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning using the MSDN (using windows.h header in C++).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, It's simply a hobby which I hope to have a future with. 
- 📫 How to reach me... Don't, I am 14 and cannot put my studies to use YET.
